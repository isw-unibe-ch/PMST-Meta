Hyow	hyow	khya1239	(csh)	South	22.37	92.17	Zakaria2018Hyow	The isocode given for PARALEX is that of Asho Chin, of which Hyow is considered to be a dialect. However, Hyow is not readily mututally intelligible with Asho and thus this isocode should not be used to refer to Hyow.	917	352	10.5281/zenodo.17788529
